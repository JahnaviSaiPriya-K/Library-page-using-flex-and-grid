In this project i have created a simple library layout by using the important concepts of css which are flex and grid
GRID
The CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.

FLEX
The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.
The flex property sets the flexible length on flexible items
